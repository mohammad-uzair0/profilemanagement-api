## ASP.NET MVC Web API Project
## Overview
This project is an ASP.NET MVC Web API application designed to provide RESTful services for managing resources. This README provides information on setting up the project, including prerequisites, restoring packages, configuring the database, running migrations, and testing the API endpoints.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed on your development machine:

- Visual Studio: It is recommended to use Visual Studio 2019 or later. Download it from the Visual Studio website.
- .NET Framework: Ensure you have the .NET Framework version specified in the project file. You can download it from the .NET website.
- SQL Server: If your project uses SQL Server for data storage, ensure you have SQL Server installed. You can use SQL Server Express for development purposes.
- Postman (Optional): For testing API endpoints, Postman can be a useful tool. Download it from the Postman website.
## Getting Started
## Clone the Repository
## Restore Packages
- Open the solution file (.sln) in Visual Studio.
- Right-click on the solution in the Solution Explorer.
- Select Restore NuGet Packages.

## Configure Connection Strings
Update the connection strings in the 'web.config' file:
#
<connectionStrings>
  <add name="DefaultConnection" connectionString="Server=YOUR_SERVER_NAME;Database=YourDatabaseName;Trusted_Connection=True;" providerName="System.Data.SqlClient" />
</connectionStrings>
Replace YOUR_SERVER_NAME with your SQL Server instance name and YourDatabaseName with the desired database name.

## Run Migrations
- Open the Package Manager Console (PMC) in Visual Studio:
- Run the following command in the PMC: Update-Database
This will create the database and apply the migrations.

## Build and Run the Project
- To build and run the project locally:
- Press Ctrl + Shift + B to build the solution.
- Press F5 to run the project in debug mode.
- The application will start, and you can access it at http://localhost:xxxx (replace xxxx with the port number displayed in Visual Studio).

## Testing API Endpoints
You can test the API endpoints using Postman or any other API testing tool. Import the provided Postman collection file (if available) to get started with testing.
